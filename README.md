# Unleashing the Dragon: Power BI and Python converge in an epic Battle Simulator Showcase

As House of the Dragon sets the stage for epic tales in the world of Westeros, imagine wielding the power of data to create a dragon battle simulator where we compare dragon's attributes, and determine the probability of victory in a fair one-on-one fight. This article unveils potential outcomes from encounters we might see in HOD Season 2 using a video game-like interface to select dragons and analyze the results from these battles. Do not worry about spoilers though. I won't reveal the real outcomes from George R. R. Martin books. This is just a battle simulator developed by collecting data from fanpages and social media with few details from the books. Overall, the main objective of the dragon battle simulator is to explain and implement basic data analytics methods like Normalization and apply weights to attributes using Python before showing the results through Power BI reports.
